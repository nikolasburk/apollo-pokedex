# apollo-pokedex

This is a _Pokedex_ app based on [GraphQL](www.graphql.com) and the [Apollo iOS Client](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-ios). Please follow the instructions in the [Apollo iOS Guide](http://dev.apollodata.com/ios/installation.html) to set it up. 

The app runs against a GraphQL backend from [Graphcool](www.graph.cool) and implements the following features:
- Adding a new Pokemon to the Pokedex
- Viewing and updating a Pokemon in the Pokedex
- Deleting a Pokemon from the Pokedex

It uses GraphQL [queries](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/), [mutations](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) and [fragments](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments).
